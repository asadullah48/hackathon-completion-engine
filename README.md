# Hackathon Completion Engine
**A Universal Framework for Systematic Hackathon Success**

> A meta-system (H0 Personal AI CTO) that manages subsequent hackathon projects (H1-H4) with human-in-the-loop oversight, reusable components, and business-grade quality standards.

## 🎯 Vision

Instead of building 5 hackathons individually, build **ONE meta-system** that builds the other four. This is the "Hackathon Completion Engine" - a spec-driven, AI-assisted framework for systematic project completion.

---

## 📊 Project Status

| Hackathon | Status | Tier | Completion |
|-----------|--------|------|------------|
| **H0: Personal AI CTO** | ✅ Complete | Bronze | 100% |
| H1: Course Companion FTE | ⏸️ Planned | - | 0% |
| H2: Todo Spec-Driven Dev | ⏸️ Planned | - | 0% |
| H3: Advanced Todo | ⏸️ Planned | - | 0% |
| H4: Cloud Deployment | ⏸️ Planned | - | 0% |

**Overall Progress:** 20% (1 of 5 complete)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The Meta-System Approach
```
H0 (Personal AI CTO) - The Engine
├── Manages → H1 (Course Companion FTE)
├── Manages → H2 (Todo Spec-Driven Development)
├── Manages → H3 (Advanced Todo Features)
└── Manages → H4 (Cloud Deployment & Scaling)
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Spec Generator** - Creates detailed specifications
2. **Skill Mapper** - Maps requirements to reusable skills
3. **Template System** - Provides project scaffolding
4. **File Watcher** - Monitors progress and files
5. **HITL Workflow** - Human oversight for decisions
6. **Dashboard** - Real-time progress tracking

## ✨ H0: Personal AI CTO (Complete)

**Status:** ✅ Bronze Tier Achieved

An autonomous file monitoring system that:
- Watches drop folder for new files
- Categorizes automatically (7 categories)
- Creates action items in Obsidian vault
- Logs all activities with timestamps
- Implements human-in-the-loop approvals

**Key Metrics:**
- 7/7 tests passing
- ~600 lines of code
- 334-line README
- Production ready

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/asadullah48/hackathon-completion-engine.git
cd hackathon-completion-engine

# Navigate to H0
cd hackathons/h0-personal-ai-cto

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run FileWatcher
python3 watchers/file_watcher.py \
    --drop-folder /mnt/d/AI-Employee-Inbox \
    --vault vault \
    --interval 10
```

## 📋 Methodology

### Spec-Driven Development
1. **Define** - Create comprehensive specification
2. **Plan** - Break into 4 sessions (Foundation → Implementation → Integration → Validation)
3. **Execute** - Claude Code implements systematically
4. **Verify** - Tests + validation checklist
5. **Document** - README + completion report

### Quality Standards
- ✅ All tests must pass
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Production-ready code
- ✅ HITL oversight for sensitive operations
- ✅ Reusable components

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (H0)

### What Worked
1. **Spec-first approach** - Clear requirements prevented scope creep
2. **Session-based execution** - 4 focused sessions maintained momentum
3. **Test-driven development** - Caught bugs early (e.g., .json categorization)
4. **Local-first design** - Obsidian vault provides transparency

### Challenges Overcome
1. Fixed file categorization bug
2. Added cross-platform path handling
3. Implemented state persistence
4. Created HITL workflow framework
